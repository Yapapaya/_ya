Before submitting your issue, make sure it has not been discussed earlier. You can search for existing tickets [here](https://github.com/Yapapaya/_ya/search).

`_ya` is just a fork of `_s` (Underscores) by Automattic [here](https://github.com/Automattic/_s) and is synced with the latest changes on reguar intervals.

So, if you have any technical, functionality and feature-related issues, it should ideally be submitted to `_s` [here](https://github.com/Automattic/_s/search).

This just changes the directory structure for automated theme builds and deletes some files that aren't needed for such a purpose. In addition all the informational files are different. (Like this one)
